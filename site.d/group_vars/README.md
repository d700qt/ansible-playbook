Place in here files/directories representing ansible groups defined in ansible inventory(ies)

There are always 2 default groups that ansible creates
- all - represents all hosts
- ungrouped - represents hosts that do not belong to a group

See
- [ansible docs on default groups](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/inventory_guide/intro_inventory.html#default-groups)
- [ansible docs on organising host and group var files](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/inventory_guide/intro_inventory.html#organizing-host-and-group-variables)
